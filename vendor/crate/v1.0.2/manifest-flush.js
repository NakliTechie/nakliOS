// Shared manifest-flush logic.
//
// Two surfaces flush the manifest back to the bucket:
//   - Crate._flushManifest (the ESM API surface; lib/crate.js)
//   - FolderUI.flushManifest (the wizard's folder UI; lib/folder.js)
//
// Both need to: re-encrypt the in-memory Manifest under the master key,
// PUT it back to .crate/manifest.jsonl.enc with If-Match against the
// last-known ETag, retry-with-replay on 412 (a peer wrote between our
// last GET and this PUT), validate the re-fetched manifest against the
// rollback anchor before trusting it, and advance the anchor on success.
//
// Until this module landed, they were near-duplicate copies that drifted
// (folder.js was missing the anchor advance + the 412 anchor check until
// v1.0.1's follow-up patch). Single source of truth here so future
// security or behaviour changes can't quietly diverge.
//
// State object shape (mutated in place — readers must see the updates):
//
//   {
//     manifest,                // Manifest instance (mutated in place on 412 replay)
//     masterKey,               // Uint8Array
//     bucketBase,              // string — bucket base URL with trailing slash
//     region, accessKey, secretKey,  // strings — for sigv4
//     manifestETag,            // string | null  ← READ + WRITTEN
//     lastFlushedEventCount,   // number          ← READ + WRITTEN
//   }
//
// The Crate class wraps its `_`-prefixed instance properties in a small
// getter/setter adapter so manifestETag / lastFlushedEventCount writes
// propagate back to this._manifestETag / this._lastFlushedEventCount.
// The FolderUI's `session` object already matches the unprefixed shape
// natively — no adapter needed.
